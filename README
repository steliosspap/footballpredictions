Football Predictions

Overview

- Developed a logistic regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Applied standard preprocessing and evaluation techniques
- Organized in a single Python script for clarity and accessibility
- Evaluated using accuracy as the primary performance metric

File Structure

- `football_predictions.py` â€“ main script containing data preprocessing, model training, and prediction logic

Example Output

```
Accuracy: 72.4%
Predictions on test data:
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...]
```

Getting Started

To replicate this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/steliosspap/footballpredictions.git
   cd footballpredictions
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python football_predictions.py
   ```

Learning Outcomes

This was one of my first experiences (16) developing a machine learning model from scratch. Key takeaways include:

- Fundamentals of data preparation and feature selection
- Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification
- Basic performance evaluation using test accuracy
- Limitations and potential areas for future improvement
