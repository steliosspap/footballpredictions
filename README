# Football Predictions

This project implements a logistic regression model to predict match outcomes in a fantasy football (soccer) league. The dataset consists of 400 observations and 8 features. Despite the relatively small size, the model achieved an accuracy exceeding 70%. This project serves as an early exploration of binary classification and predictive modeling.

## Overview

- Developed a logistic regression model using `scikit-learn`
- Applied standard preprocessing and evaluation techniques
- Organized in a single Python script for clarity and accessibility
- Evaluated using accuracy as the primary performance metric

## File Structure

- `football_predictions.py` â€“ main script containing data preprocessing, model training, and prediction logic

> Note: For clarity and professionalism, it is recommended to rename the current file from `TheFinalCopy (2).py` to `football_predictions.py`.

## Example Output

```
Accuracy: 72.4%
Predictions on test data:
[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...]
```

## Getting Started

To replicate this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/steliosspap/footballpredictions.git
   cd footballpredictions
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Execute the script:
   ```bash
   python football_predictions.py
   ```

## Learning Outcomes

This was one of my first experiences developing a machine learning model from scratch. Key takeaways include:

- Fundamentals of data preparation and feature selection
- Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification
- Basic performance evaluation using test accuracy
- Limitations and potential areas for future improvement
